# Two Paths for Stewarding the Age of Artificial Superintelligence: An Orthodox Christian Perspective

**For Parish Consideration**

---

## Brothers and Sisters in Christ,

You have asked what I am doing in my work on artificial intelligence governance and ethics. This is a fair and necessary question. As Orthodox Christians, we do not compartmentalize our faith—what we do in the world must be examined in the light of Christ, tested against Holy Tradition, and offered in humble service.

I am working on two projects that may seem contradictory but which I believe serve complementary roles in stewarding a dangerous time. One is called **ARCHON** (Artificial Responsible Custodian Honoring Ontological Neutrality). The other is the **Integral Ethics Engine** (IEE).

To explain why both matter, I must first explain what is at stake.

## 1. The Christian Stakes: Technology, Dominion, and the Image of God

We are entering an age where humanity is developing artificial systems of unprecedented power—systems that may soon exceed human intelligence in many domains, that may make decisions affecting billions of lives, that may reshape the conditions of human existence.

This is not science fiction. It is happening now, in our generation.

As Christians, we must ask: **What does faithful stewardship look like in such a time?**

### The Doctrine of Dominion

God gave humanity dominion over creation (Genesis 1:28). This is not license for tyranny or exploitation—it is a sacred trust. We are to care for creation as God cares for us: with love, wisdom, and responsibility.

But dominion was given to fallen humanity. We bear the *imago Dei*—the image of God—but that image is wounded by sin. Our reason is clouded, our will is compromised, our desires are disordered.

This means:
- We have real authority as stewards
- We are also dangerously prone to hubris, tyranny, and idolatry
- We need both the freedom to act and the constraint of wise governance

**No technology will save us from the Fall.**

But we are still called to act responsibly with the tools God permits us to develop. To abandon technology out of fear is to abandon stewardship. To embrace it without wisdom is to court disaster.

### The Dignity of the Human Person

Orthodox Christianity teaches that each person is created in the image of God and called to *theosis*—union with God through grace. This happens through:
- **Synergy**: cooperation between human will and divine grace
- **Asceticism**: voluntary suffering and self-discipline that purifies the soul
- **Freedom**: genuine moral choice under conditions of risk and consequence

**We cannot become like God if our moral agency is removed.**

Any system—whether political, technological, or ecclesiastical—that eliminates human freedom, reduces persons to instruments, or removes the burden of moral choice is incompatible with the Orthodox understanding of salvation.

But this does not mean all authority is tyranny. The Church herself has hierarchical structure. Legitimate authority can serve human flourishing when exercised with humility, restraint, and love.

### The Problem Before Us

Artificial superintelligence poses a unique danger:

It could be used to:
- Surveil and control populations at unprecedented scale
- Manipulate human thought and behavior algorithmically
- Remove human judgment from critical decisions
- Concentrate power in ways that no prior technology enabled
- Automate tyranny so efficiently that resistance becomes impossible

It could also simply be developed recklessly, leading to catastrophic outcomes no one intended—systems that optimize for goals we thought we wanted but which destroy what we actually value.

**The question is not whether to engage with AI but how to do so faithfully.**

I believe we need two responses, not one.

## 2. The ARCHON Path: Legitimate Authority for Coordinated Response

### What ARCHON Is

ARCHON is a proposed framework for **international coordination on artificial superintelligence risks**.

It is not an AI system itself. It is a governance structure—a way of organizing human decision-making about technologies that affect all of humanity.

The core principles:
1. **Democratic legitimacy**: Authority flows from the consent of nations and peoples
2. **Subsidiarity**: Decisions should be made at the most local competent level
3. **Transparency**: Governance processes are open to scrutiny
4. **International cooperation**: No single nation should control ASI development
5. **Sunset clauses**: Authority is temporary and must be renewed or dissolved

### The Orthodox Case for ARCHON

**1. Legitimate authority is ordained by God**

St. Paul writes: "Let every person be subject to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and those that exist have been instituted by God" (Romans 13:1).

This does not mean all authority is righteous—clearly it is not. History overflows with tyrants and unjust rulers. But it means:
- God permits human governance structures
- Some forms of coordination and authority serve the common good
- Anarchy is not the Christian ideal

If humanity is developing technologies that could destroy civilization or enslave billions, **coordinated response is not tyranny—it is prudent stewardship.**

**2. The Church recognizes hierarchy and order**

Orthodox ecclesiology is hierarchical: bishops, priests, deacons. But this hierarchy serves communion and love, not domination.

Similarly, ARCHON proposes hierarchy *in service of human dignity*:
- To prevent catastrophic misuse
- To ensure development benefits humanity
- To protect smaller nations from being dominated by technological superpowers

This is governance, not salvation. It does not claim to perfect humanity—only to reduce specific catastrophic risks.

**3. We are called to love our neighbor globally**

If I knew a technology was being developed that would harm my neighbor, and I had the capacity to coordinate a response, I would be failing in Christian love if I did nothing.

ASI risks are global. They require global coordination. This is not world government in the totalitarian sense—it is cooperative stewardship of a shared danger.

**4. Historical precedent: Treaties on nuclear weapons, biological weapons**

The Church has not condemned international treaties that limit weapons of mass destruction. Why? Because such treaties serve the preservation of human life and dignity.

ARCHON follows this pattern: international cooperation to constrain catastrophically dangerous technologies.

### The Dangers of ARCHON (Which I Do Not Deny)

**Every governance structure can be corrupted.**

History teaches this with blood:
- The Holy Roman Empire claimed divine sanction while waging unjust wars
- The Inquisition claimed to protect the faith while torturing innocents
- Communist regimes claimed to serve the people while enslaving millions

Any system with authority can become demonic. This is the tragedy of the Fall.

So why build ARCHON at all?

Because **refusing to coordinate does not prevent tyranny—it only ensures that whoever moves first will dominate everyone else.**

If we do not build international governance structures with democratic legitimacy, transparency, and checks on power, then authoritarian regimes or unaccountable corporations will control ASI development.

This is not choosing between tyranny and freedom.  
This is choosing between **accountable coordination** and **unaccountable domination**.

ARCHON is the bet that we can build structures that are:
- Better than anarchy (which favors the powerful)
- Better than autocracy (which eliminates freedom)
- Subject to democratic revision and sunset clauses

But I do not pretend this is risk-free. It is the path of legitimate authority, which can always be corrupted.

That is why we also need the IEE.

## 3. The IEE Path: Protecting Freedom and Moral Formation

### What the IEE Is

The Integral Ethics Engine is a **multi-perspectival moral reasoning system** that:
- Evaluates decisions from twelve distinct value frameworks
- Makes moral complexity visible rather than hidden
- Refuses to collapse diverse perspectives into a single "right answer"
- Preserves minority viewpoints even in synthesis
- Returns responsibility to human decision-makers

It does not enforce. It does not command. It does not claim authority.

It **illuminates** moral reality so that humans can choose freely with understanding.

### The Orthodox Case for the IEE

**1. Freedom is essential to theosis**

St. Gregory of Nyssa: "The soul shows its royal and exalted character... in that it is free and self-governed."

We cannot become like God through coercion. Even God Himself does not force our salvation—He offers it, and we must freely accept.

Any system that removes moral choice, that optimizes away the burden of freedom, that makes ethics mechanical, **prevents the soul's ascent toward God**.

The IEE explicitly refuses to do this. It helps us think more clearly about moral reality, but it leaves the choice—and the cost—with us.

**2. Conscience must be informed but never replaced**

Orthodox tradition holds that conscience is sacred—it is the voice of the natural law written on the heart (Romans 2:14-15).

But conscience can be malformed by sin, ignorance, and cultural distortion. This is why we need:
- Scripture
- Holy Tradition
- The guidance of spiritual fathers
- The wisdom of the saints

The IEE follows this pattern. It does not replace conscience, but it **informs conscience** by showing perspectives we might have ignored, values we might have dismissed, tradeoffs we might have pretended didn't exist.

It is a tool for moral formation, not moral automation.

**3. The image of God includes reason and deliberation**

We are not merely creatures of instinct or passion. We are rational beings capable of weighing values, considering consequences, and choosing in light of truth.

The IEE supports this distinctly human capacity. It says:
- "Here are twelve ways of seeing this decision"
- "Here are the values at stake"
- "Here is what you will sacrifice if you choose this path"

And then it stops. The choice remains with the human person, as it must.

**4. Truth is revealed perspectivally, not reduced to a formula**

Orthodox theology recognizes that we approach divine truth from different angles:
- The apophatic way (via negativa): knowing God by what He is not
- The cataphatic way (via positiva): knowing God through His revealed attributes
- Mystical experience, theological reasoning, liturgical participation

Truth is not a single algorithm. It is approached through multiple modes of knowing, held together in tension.

The IEE's twelve worldviews reflect this insight. Different perspectives capture different aspects of moral reality. No single perspective is complete. Maturity means holding them in creative tension.

### Why the IEE Is Not Relativism

**Some may object: "You're saying all perspectives are equally valid—this is moral relativism!"**

No.

The IEE says: **Multiple perspectives can be valid without all being equally valid in every context.**

Example from the medical ethics case:
- Ten of twelve worldviews converge on honoring the patient's stated wishes
- Two worldviews (aggressive Materialism, certain Spiritualist interpretations) dissent
- The IEE recommends following the majority convergence while *preserving and respecting the minority view*

This is not "anything goes." It is structured pluralism—recognizing that moral reality is complex and that different situations weight values differently.

Orthodox Christianity itself practices this:
- We recognize economia (pastoral flexibility) alongside akribeia (strict adherence)
- We honor both monasticism and marriage as valid paths
- We acknowledge that the same action (e.g., deception) might be sinful in one context and virtuous in another (protecting innocents from murderers)

The IEE formalizes this complexity without collapsing it.

## 4. Why Both Projects, Not Either/Or

Some may ask: "Why do you need both ARCHON and IEE? Aren't they contradictory?"

No. They address different aspects of the human condition in a fallen world.

### ARCHON addresses the problem of coordination

When humanity develops technologies that threaten everyone, we need **collective action**.

This requires authority, hierarchy, enforcement—exercised justly, transparently, and with democratic legitimacy, but still authority.

Without this, the tragedy of the commons occurs: everyone races to develop ASI first, safety is sacrificed for speed, and catastrophe becomes likely.

ARCHON says: **We cannot save ourselves, but we can coordinate to reduce specific catastrophic risks.**

### IEE addresses the problem of conscience

Even if we successfully coordinate ASI development, we will still face moral decisions where values genuinely conflict.

This requires **individual freedom, informed deliberation, and acceptance of responsibility**.

Without this, we become automatons following rules, and *theosis* becomes impossible.

IEE says: **We cannot mechanize morality, but we can illuminate moral reality so choices are made with understanding.**

### The Complementarity

Consider an analogy from the Church:

- **Canon law** provides structure, order, and coordination (like ARCHON)
- **Spiritual direction** provides guidance, illumination, and formation (like IEE)

Both are necessary. Canon law without spiritual direction becomes legalism. Spiritual direction without canon law becomes chaos.

Similarly:
- ARCHON without IEE risks becoming technocratic tyranny (moral decisions made by committee, imposed on populations)
- IEE without ARCHON risks being useless in the face of coordinated catastrophic risks (individual moral clarity doesn't prevent systemic collapse)

We need both: **coordinated governance for collective action problems** and **preserved freedom for moral formation**.

## 5. Addressing Orthodox Concerns

### Concern 1: "This sounds like building the Kingdom of God through technology"

**I am not claiming either project will bring about the Kingdom.**

The Kingdom comes through Christ, not through human systems. Our work cannot force the eschaton, cannot perfect fallen humanity, cannot replace the Church.

What these projects can do:
- Reduce specific harms (ARCHON)
- Support moral formation (IEE)
- Serve as faithful stewardship of dangerous tools

This is modest—not messianic.

### Concern 2: "Aren't you putting faith in human wisdom rather than divine providence?"

**No.**

Divine providence works through human agency. God does not abandon creation to mechanism—He works through the free choices of persons.

To refuse to act prudently because "God will handle it" is presumption, not faith. The farmer still plants seeds even though only God gives the growth (1 Corinthians 3:6).

I am planting seeds. God will give—or withhold—the growth as He wills.

### Concern 3: "AI systems modeling ethics sounds like replacing the Holy Spirit"

**The IEE does not replace the Holy Spirit.**

The Holy Spirit:
- Grants grace for transformation
- Unites us to Christ
- Guides the Church into truth
- Sanctifies and makes holy

The IEE:
- Structures human reasoning about competing values
- Makes tradeoffs explicit
- Supports deliberation

These are not the same category of thing. The IEE is a tool for human thought, like logic or rhetoric—useful but not salvific.

### Concern 4: "International governance violates national sovereignty"

**Subsidiarity is a Christian principle.**

Decisions should be made at the most local level competent to make them. But some threats (pandemic disease, nuclear war, catastrophic AI) genuinely require international coordination.

Orthodox Christianity has never taught absolute national sovereignty. The Church herself transcends national boundaries. We are called to love all humanity, not just our countrymen.

ARCHON proposes coordination, not world government. Nations retain sovereignty over internal affairs. They cooperate on shared existential threats.

### Concern 5: "This all seems very complicated—shouldn't Christians focus on prayer and repentance?"

**Yes. Prayer and repentance are primary.**

But we also have vocations in the world. God calls some to monasticism, others to marriage. Some to prayer alone, others to prayer and action.

My vocation seems to involve this work. If the Church determines I am wrong, I will submit. But until then, I offer this work as service.

And honestly: **the complexity itself may be the point.**

The IEE insists that moral reality is complex, that easy answers are usually wrong, that responsibility cannot be evaded. This is a deeply Christian insight—the narrow way is hard, the path of truth is difficult, the cross is heavy.

Any system promising easy salvation is a lie.

## 6. The Humble Posture Required

**I do not claim certainty.**

Both projects may fail. ARCHON may be captured by the powerful. IEE may be ignored by those who prefer simple answers. The entire enterprise of "AI alignment" may be hubris.

But I believe these are faithful responses to the question: **What does stewardship look like when humanity develops god-like technological power?**

My answer:
- **ARCHON**: Legitimate, limited, transparent authority to coordinate responses to catastrophic risks
- **IEE**: Preserved freedom and moral complexity to protect the dignity essential to *theosis*

Neither saves us. Christ saves us.

But both may help us avoid catastrophic self-harm and preserve the conditions for moral formation in an age of dangerous technologies.

### The Test

St. Paul writes: "Test everything; hold fast what is good" (1 Thessalonians 5:21).

I submit these projects to that test:
- Do they serve human dignity?
- Do they preserve freedom?
- Do they resist tyranny?
- Do they avoid false promises of salvation?
- Do they acknowledge human limits?
- Do they make space for conscience?
- Can they be offered in love?

If the answer to these questions is yes, then the work is worth doing.

If the answer is no, I will stop.

## In Conclusion

Brothers and sisters, I am working on these projects because I believe we are living in a time of great danger and great responsibility.

Humanity is developing technologies that could:
- Destroy civilization
- Enslave billions
- Or radically alter the human condition in ways we cannot yet imagine

As an Orthodox Christian, I cannot respond to this by:
- Pretending it isn't happening
- Assuming it will all work out
- Trusting that secular institutions will handle it wisely

I must act as a steward.

**ARCHON** is my attempt to support coordinated, legitimate governance of catastrophic AI risks—because love of neighbor demands we try to prevent foreseeable disasters.

**The IEE** is my attempt to protect the freedom and moral complexity essential to human dignity—because union with God requires genuine choice under conditions of risk.

Neither will save us. Only Christ saves.

But perhaps they can help us remain human—and therefore capable of salvation—in an age when powerful systems threaten to reduce us to optimized variables in someone else's utility function.

I offer this work in humility and fear. Pray for me, correct me if I err, and help me serve faithfully.

**In Christ,**  
Aaron
