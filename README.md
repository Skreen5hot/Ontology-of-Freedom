# Ontology-of-Freedom
Ontology-of-Freedom is a research-driven project dedicated to extending the boundaries of Realist ontology by integrating the ethical individualism and epistemic freedom articulated in Rudolf Steinerâ€™s Philosophy of Freedom. The project explores how ontologies can faithfully model not only biological and social reality but also the inner life of intention, moral intuition, and creative action. By building on the rigor of the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) and pushing it toward a fuller account of processual, contextual, and experiential qualities, this initiative aims to create a formal ontology that honors both the objective world and the freedom of human knowing and acting within it.

The repository includes foundational white papers, modeling patterns, and experimental ontological modules that support a new generation of semantically rigorous yet spiritually aware knowledge systems.
