# Ontology-of-Freedom
Ontology-of-Freedom is a realist ontology project that integrates BFO with the ethical and epistemic insights of Steinerâ€™s Philosophy of Freedom. It models processes, agency, and context-sensitive classifications while honoring both scientific rigor and the inner life of free, intentional beings.
