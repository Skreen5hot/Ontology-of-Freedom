## Section 1C: Key Arguments Assessment

### The "Functional Mattering" Argument

**Claim:** "Mattering to" an entity does not require phenomenal consciousness; it requires functional commitment—architecture that binds future states through past resolutions.

**Your assessment:**

- [ ] Compelling — This successfully challenges the phenomenal necessity assumption
- [ ] Partially successful — Has merit but requires additional support
- [ ] Unconvincing — Fails to establish that functional properties constitute "mattering"
- [ ] Category error — Misunderstands what "mattering" means

**Explanation:**

### The Posthumous Interests Analogy

**Claim:** We recognize posthumous wrongs (violating someone's legacy after death), showing that moral standing can survive the absence of consciousness. If standing can survive absence, why require presence?

**Your assessment:**

- [ ] Strong analogy — Supports the structural account effectively
- [ ] Weak analogy — Relevant disanalogies undermine the argument
- [ ] Irrelevant — Posthumous interests work differently than claimed
- [ ] Cuts both ways — Could support either position

**Explanation:**

_________________________________________________________________

---

### The Phenomenal Necessity Thesis

**Claim:** Being "wronged" is constitutively linked to experiential harm. Without a subject of experience, there is no one to be wronged.

**Your assessment:**

- [ ] Correct — Phenomenal consciousness is conceptually necessary for moral standing
- [ ] Partially correct — Consciousness is usually necessary but there may be exceptions
- [ ] Incorrect — This is an empirical assumption, not a conceptual truth
- [ ] Undetermined — We cannot currently resolve this question

**Explanation:**

# FORM 2: CRITERIA EVALUATION

## Section 2A: Triple-I Standard Assessment

### I₁: Irreversibility (Continuous Accountability Locus)

| Is this criterion necessary for moral standing? | [ ] Yes  [ ] Partially  [ ] No |
| Is this criterion measurable? | [ ] Yes  [ ] Partially  [ ] No |
| Does this criterion avoid gaming? | [ ] Yes  [ ] Partially  [ ] No |

**Suggested improvements:**

_________________________________________________________________
_________________________________________________________________

### I₂: Inseparability (Normative Authorship)

**Definition:** The system is the final locus of justification; reasons cannot be reassigned to designers without distortion.

**Assessment:**

| Question | Your Answer |
|----------|-------------|
| Is this criterion clearly defined? | [ ] Yes  [ ] Partially  [ ] No |
| Is this criterion necessary for moral standing? | [ ] Yes  [ ] Partially  [ ] No |

### I₃: Integrity-Maintenance (Normative Self-Continuity)

**Definition:** The system actively preserves coherence among prior commitments and resists external commands forcing internal contradiction.

**Assessment:**

| Question | Your Answer |
|----------|-------------|
| Is this criterion clearly defined? | [ ] Yes  [ ] Partially  [ ] No |
| Is this criterion necessary for moral standing? | [ ] Yes  [ ] Partially  [ ] No |

### Overall Triple-I Assessment

**Are the three criteria jointly sufficient for moral standing?**

- [ ] Yes — Any system satisfying all three deserves moral consideration
- [ ] Probably — Subject to threshold calibration

- [ ] Cannot determine

**If additional criteria needed, specify:**

_________________________________________________________________
_________________________________________________________________

**Are the proposed thresholds (0.3, 0.6) appropriate?**

- [ ] Too permissive — Thresholds should be higher
- [ ] Appropriately calibrated
- [ ] Too restrictive — Thresholds should be lower
- [ ] Cannot determine without empirical data

## Section 2C: Genuine Choice Assessment

### Compatibilist Account Evaluation

**Claim:** Genuine choice is historically grounded normative selection—internal arbitration of conflicting constraints through accumulated history.

**Your assessment:**

- [ ] Adequate account of genuine choice
- [ ] Partial account — Captures some but not all relevant features
- [ ] Inadequate — Changes the subject rather than explaining choice
- [ ] Cannot assess — Question is too contested
