# External Review Panel: Reviewer Guidance

**Document Type:** Methodological Guidance for Panel Members
**Version:** 1.0

---

## I. Your Role as External Reviewer

You are serving as one of at least three external ethicists convened to evaluate the Architectonic Agency Theory (AAT) framework. Your role is to provide **independent, rigorous philosophical assessment**—not to reach predetermined conclusions.

### What Makes a Good Review

| Quality | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Charitable** | Engage with the strongest version of each argument |
| **Critical** | Identify genuine weaknesses, not surface objections |
| **Constructive** | Suggest improvements where arguments fail |
| **Independent** | Form your own view before panel discussion |
| **Honest** | Report uncertainty rather than feigning confidence |

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Dismissiveness:** "This is obviously wrong" without engagement
- **Credulity:** "This is obviously right" without stress-testing
- **Scope Drift:** Evaluating claims the framework doesn't make
- **Tu Quoque:** "Traditional ethics has problems too" without comparative analysis
- **Appeal to Intuition:** "This just feels wrong" without principled argument

## II. Evaluation Framework

### Level 1: Internal Validity

**Question:** Does the argument succeed *on its own terms*?

| Check | Question |
|-------|----------|
| **Logical Validity** | Do conclusions follow from premises? |
| **Premise Plausibility** | Are premises defensible, even if contested? |
| **Consistency** | Does the framework contradict itself? |
| **Completeness** | Are there obvious gaps or missing cases? |

**Guidance:** An internally valid argument may still be wrong if its premises are false, but it should be evaluated as a coherent position.

### Level 2: External Plausibility

**Question:** How does the argument fare against the best objections?

| Check | Question |
|-------|----------|
| **Objection Anticipation** | Does the framework address obvious counterarguments? |
| **Objection Quality** | Are the responses adequate? |
| **Literature Engagement** | Does it engage with relevant prior work? |
| **Counterexample Resilience** | Can it handle challenging cases? |

**Guidance:** A plausible argument needn't convince everyone, but it should withstand scrutiny from informed critics.

### Level 3: Practical Tractability

**Question:** Can the framework be operationalized?

| Check | Question |
|-------|----------|
| **Measurability** | Can proposed criteria be assessed empirically? |
| **Discriminability** | Can criteria distinguish relevantly different cases? |
| **Implementation Path** | Is there a realistic route from theory to practice? |
| **Governance Fit** | Can existing institutions adapt to the framework? |

**Guidance:** A practically intractable framework may be theoretically interesting but operationally useless.

## III. Specific Evaluation Criteria

### A. Evaluating the Consciousness-Standing Claim

**The Claim:** Moral standing can be grounded in structural normative authorship rather than requiring phenomenal consciousness.

**Questions to Consider:**

1. **Conceptual:** Is there a coherent notion of "mattering to" an entity that doesn't require experience?

2. **Analogical:** Do the analogies invoked (posthumous interests, moral injury, corporate personhood) genuinely support the claim, or are they disanalogous in relevant ways?

3. **Phenomenological:** Does the framework adequately engage with phenomenological objections (Nagel, Levinas, Merleau-Ponty)?

4. **Burden of Proof:** Where should the burden of proof lie—with those claiming non-conscious systems *can* have standing, or those claiming they *cannot*?

### B. Evaluating the Triple-I Standard

**The Criteria:**
- I₁: Irreversibility (continuous accountability locus)
- I₂: Inseparability (normative authorship)
- I₃: Integrity-Maintenance (coherence under pressure)

**Questions to Consider:**

1. **Necessity:** Are all three criteria necessary? Could a system satisfy two but not deserve standing?

2. **Sufficiency:** Are the three criteria jointly sufficient? Could a system satisfy all three but still not deserve standing?

3. **Measurability:** Can these criteria be operationalized reliably? What would measurement look like?

4. **Threshold Setting:** How should thresholds (0.3, 0.6) be determined? Are they principled or arbitrary?

5. **Gaming Risk:** Could systems be designed to score high on Triple-I without genuinely possessing the underlying properties?

### C. Evaluating the Answerability Framework

**The Model:** Layered answerability with institutional default, conditional synthetic agent responsibility.

**Questions to Consider:**

1. **Gap Analysis:** Are there cases where responsibility would fall through the cracks?

2. **Overlap Analysis:** Are there cases where multiple parties would bear conflicting responsibilities?

3. **Enforcement:** How would synthetic agent "answerability" be enforced? What are the sanctions?

4. **Institutional Design:** Is the proposed IRB model workable? What are its failure modes?

### D. Evaluating the Genuine Choice Analysis

**The Claim:** Genuine choice is compatibilist—historically grounded normative selection, not metaphysical indeterminacy.

**Questions to Consider:**

1. **Adequacy:** Does this account capture what we mean by "genuine choice"? Or does it change the subject?

2. **Distinguishability:** Can the proposed behavioral signatures reliably distinguish genuine choice from sophisticated mimicry?

3. **Threshold:** At what point does "normative compression" become genuine deliberation?

4. **Implications:** If this account is correct, what follows for human moral responsibility?

### E. Evaluating the Pathway Recommendation

**The Recommendation:** Hybrid pathway with staged implementation and empirical gates.

**Questions to Consider:**

1. **Calibration:** Is the timeline (3/7/15 years) appropriately calibrated to likely technological development?

2. **Gate Design:** Are the success/failure criteria for each phase appropriate?

3. **Risk Balance:** Does the pathway appropriately balance Type I (false positive) and Type II (false negative) errors?

4. **Alternatives:** Should a different pathway be recommended? Why?

## IV. Engaging with Controversial Claims

AAT makes several claims that challenge philosophical orthodoxy. When evaluating these, consider:

### The Principle of Charity

Before rejecting a claim, ask:
- What is the strongest version of this argument?
- What would have to be true for this to succeed?
- Am I rejecting the claim or my interpretation of it?

### The Principle of Proportionality

Match your confidence to your evidence:
- Strong claims require strong evidence
- Contested claims warrant expressed uncertainty
- Novel claims deserve exploratory engagement

### The Principle of Consequences

Consider downstream implications:
- If this claim is true, what follows?
- If this claim is false, what follows?
- Are the practical stakes relevant to the philosophical assessment?

## V. Structured Disagreement Protocol

When panel members disagree, use this protocol:

### Step 1: Clarify the Disagreement

| Question | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| Is this a disagreement about *premises* or *inference*? | Locates the dispute |
| Is this a disagreement about *fact* or *value*? | Identifies resolution path |
| Is this a disagreement about *framework* or *application*? | Scopes the issue |

### Step 2: Steelman Each Side

Each disputant must articulate the opposing position charitably before critiquing it.

### Step 3: Identify Cruxes

What evidence or argument would change each party's mind? If nothing would, acknowledge the disagreement as fundamental.

### Step 4: Document the Disagreement

Record:
- The precise claim in dispute
- Each position's strongest argument
- Areas of partial agreement
- Whether the disagreement is resolvable in principle

## VI. Confidentiality and Ethics

### Confidentiality

- Review materials should not be shared outside the panel
- Panel deliberations are confidential until report publication
- Individual reviewer positions may be anonymized in final report

### Conflicts of Interest

Please disclose if you have:
- Financial interests in AI development companies
- Prior public positions on AAT or related frameworks
- Personal relationships with project authors
- Institutional pressures that might affect your assessment

### Intellectual Honesty

- Report your genuine views, not what you think we want to hear
- Acknowledge uncertainty where it exists
- Change your mind if presented with compelling arguments
- Attribute ideas correctly in written feedback
